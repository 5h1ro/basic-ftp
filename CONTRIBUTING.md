# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Please keep in mind that this project has clearly defined [goals and non-goals](README.md). There are many features one could add to an FTP library. The main feature of this one is being easy to compose and extend while the API should stay small.

That being said, what do I know. Maybe you'll take the library to a far more interesting place. In any case, open an issue before devoting too much time preparing a pull request and let's have a chat.

## Testing

- `npm test` runs unit tests.
- `npm run tdd` runs unit tests automatically every time a file changed.
- `npm run lint` runs the linter.
