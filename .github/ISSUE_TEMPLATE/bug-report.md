Use `client.ftp.verbose = true` to log every communication detail. Copy-paste the output of your console here. Make sure to redact IPs, URLs or passwords.

**Which version of Node.js are you using?**
e.g. Node 1.11.0

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here. What FTP server are you using? What environment are you running in?
